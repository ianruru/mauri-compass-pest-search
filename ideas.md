### Design Movement: Modern Environmentalism / Clean Tech
A fusion of nature-inspired aesthetics with modern, clean technology interfaces. This style emphasizes clarity, accessibility, and the seriousness of environmental protection while maintaining a welcoming and educational tone.

### Core Principles
1. **Clarity & Focus**: Content is king. High-quality images and clear typography take center stage to aid identification.
2. **Nature-Tech Balance**: Use organic colors but structured, grid-based layouts that feel precise and scientific.
3. **Accessibility First**: High contrast, clear hierarchy, and intuitive navigation for all age groups and technical abilities.
4. **Action-Oriented**: Clear calls to action for reporting pests or learning management strategies.

### Color Philosophy
- **Primary**: Deep Forest Green (oklch(0.35 0.12 145)) - Represents established native flora and authority.
- **Secondary**: Alert Orange (oklch(0.65 0.18 45)) - Used sparingly for alerts and warnings (invasive species).
- **Background**: Soft Stone (oklch(0.97 0.01 100)) - A neutral, natural background that reduces eye strain compared to pure white.
- **Accent**: Sky Blue (oklch(0.75 0.12 240)) - For interactive elements and freshwater contexts.
*Reasoning*: The palette grounds the user in the environment while using alert colors functionally to highlight threats.

### Layout Paradigm
- **Card-Based Grid**: A responsive masonry or strict grid layout for the species gallery, allowing for efficient scanning.
- **Split-Screen Details**: On desktop, detail pages use a fixed side panel for key data (Latin name, type) while the main content scrolls.
- **Sticky Filters**: A robust filtering sidebar or top bar that remains accessible as users browse the extensive list.

### Signature Elements
1. **"Bio-Cards"**: Species cards with rounded corners, subtle drop shadows, and a clear "status" indicator (e.g., Alert icon).
2. **Organic Shapes**: Subtle background patterns resembling topographic lines or leaf veins to break up solid blocks.
3. **Data Tags**: Pill-shaped tags for categories (Plants, Animals) that are color-coded for quick visual sorting.

### Interaction Philosophy
- **Hover-to-Reveal**: Hovering over a species card reveals quick actions (View Details, Report).
- **Instant Search**: Real-time filtering as the user types, with immediate visual feedback.
- **Smooth Transitions**: Page transitions that feel like sliding panes of glass, emphasizing the "clean" tech aspect.

### Animation
- **Fade-in Entry**: Elements cascade in gently upon load.
- **Scale on Hover**: Cards slightly lift (scale up 1.02x) and shadow deepens on interaction.
- **Skeleton Loading**: mimicking the card layout during data fetch to maintain layout stability.

### Typography System
- **Headings**: 'Outfit' or 'Manrope' - Modern, geometric sans-serifs that feel friendly but technical.
- **Body**: 'Inter' or 'Public Sans' - Highly legible for dense information.
- **Hierarchy**: Large, bold headings for species names; uppercase, tracked-out labels for metadata (LATIN NAME, TYPE).

### Design Movement: Neo-Brutalist / Field Guide
A bold, high-contrast style inspired by field guides and warning signage. It uses thick borders, stark typography, and high-saturation colors to create a sense of urgency and importance suitable for pest management.

### Core Principles
1. **High Impact**: Information should be punchy and impossible to miss.
2. **Raw & Direct**: No unnecessary decoration; form follows function strictly.
3. **Structural Visibility**: Layout grids and sections are clearly defined with visible borders.
4. **Urgency**: The design language communicates that these are pests requiring attention.

### Color Philosophy
- **Primary**: Hazard Yellow (oklch(0.85 0.18 95)) - Attention-grabbing, used for backgrounds or key highlights.
- **Secondary**: Stark Black (oklch(0.15 0 0)) - For text and heavy borders.
- **Accent**: Warning Red (oklch(0.55 0.22 25)) - For critical alerts and "Do Not" indicators.
- **Neutral**: Paper White (oklch(0.99 0 0)) - High contrast background for readability.
*Reasoning*: Mimics the visual language of hazard signs and field equipment, reinforcing the "pest control" context.

### Layout Paradigm
- **Modular Grid**: Strict, visible grid lines separating content areas.
- **Asymmetric Headers**: Large, bold headers that might overlap or break the grid slightly for visual interest.
- **Sidebar Navigation**: A persistent, heavy-bordered sidebar for navigation and filtering.

### Signature Elements
1. **Thick Borders**: 2px-4px solid black borders on all cards and sections.
2. **Monospace Accents**: Use of monospace fonts for data points (Latin names, dates) to feel like scientific logs.
3. **Hard Shadows**: Solid, non-blurred drop shadows (box-shadow: 4px 4px 0px #000) for buttons and cards.

### Interaction Philosophy
- **Tactile Clicks**: Buttons depress visually (translate) without fading, feeling mechanical.
- **Snap Scrolling**: Content snaps into place, feeling rigid and precise.
- **Toggle Switches**: Large, physical-feeling toggles for filters.

### Animation
- **Instant State Changes**: Minimal transition times; hover states snap rather than fade.
- **Marquee Text**: Scrolling text for urgent alerts or announcements.
- **Glitch Effects**: Subtle glitch effects on hover for "invasive" species to suggest disruption.

### Typography System
- **Headings**: 'Space Grotesk' or 'Chakra Petch' - Boxy, somewhat aggressive sans-serifs.
- **Body**: 'JetBrains Mono' or 'Roboto Mono' - For a technical, data-driven look.
- **Hierarchy**: Massive size contrast; headings are huge, body text is compact and dense.

### Design Movement: Soft Naturalism / Watercolor Journal
A gentle, artistic approach that frames the database as a curated collection of nature observations. It uses soft textures, muted colors, and elegant typography to encourage exploration and learning without alarmism.

### Core Principles
1. **Curiosity & Exploration**: Encourage users to browse and learn through beautiful presentation.
2. **Organic Flow**: Layouts that feel fluid and less rigid than traditional grids.
3. **Visual Harmony**: Colors and typography that blend seamlessly with the nature photography.
4. **Gentle Education**: Informing users about pests without aggressive "warning" aesthetics.

### Color Philosophy
- **Primary**: Sage Green (oklch(0.75 0.08 150)) - Calming, natural base.
- **Secondary**: Earth Brown (oklch(0.45 0.08 60)) - For text and grounding elements.
- **Accent**: Muted Coral (oklch(0.75 0.12 30)) - For highlights and alerts, but softened.
- **Background**: Cream / Off-White (oklch(0.98 0.02 95)) - Like high-quality paper.
*Reasoning*: Creates a "field journal" vibe that is pleasant to use, reducing anxiety while still providing necessary information.

### Layout Paradigm
- **Masonry Gallery**: A loose, masonry-style layout for images that respects their aspect ratios.
- **Centered Reading**: Detail pages focus on a central column of text with floating images, like a magazine article.
- **Overlay Navigation**: A minimal, transparent navigation bar that lets content shine through.

### Signature Elements
1. **Paper Texture**: Subtle grain or paper texture overlays on backgrounds.
2. **Watercolor Blobs**: Abstract, soft-edged shapes behind images or headers.
3. **Serif Headings**: Elegant serif fonts for a classic, scientific journal feel.

### Interaction Philosophy
- **Slow Reveals**: Content fades in slowly as you scroll.
- **Parallax**: Subtle parallax effects on background elements or images.
- **Soft Hovers**: Gentle color shifts and blurs rather than sharp movements.

### Animation
- **Float**: Elements gently float or drift into place.
- **Blur-in**: Images blur into focus upon loading.
- **Ripple**: Subtle ripple effects on buttons (freshwater theme).

### Typography System
- **Headings**: 'Playfair Display' or 'Lora' - Elegant, high-contrast serifs.
- **Body**: 'Lato' or 'Nunito' - Round, friendly sans-serifs.
- **Hierarchy**: Emphasis on weight and italics rather than just size; use of italics for Latin names is crucial.
